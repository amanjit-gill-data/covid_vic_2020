            Welcome. This website documents Victoria's progression through a second wave of COVID-19.
            On this page, you will find videos and graphs that were updated once a day, using data from 
            the Victorian DHHS (Department of Health and Human Services). These videos and graphs show 
            how the number of active cases in each LGA (local government area) changed throughout 
            the second wave.<br><br>

            This website charts the second wave from June 14 onwards, as this was the last
            date before the total number of active cases in Victoria entered double digits. From this point on,
            the number of cases began to increase beyond the levels seen in the first wave of the virus.<br><br>

            The last date captured on this website is November 6. This date marked the seventh day in a row that
            no new cases of COVID-19 were detected in Victoria, signifying the end of the second wave.

        <p>
            The first video shows how the virus spread across Melbourne during the second wave. At the peak
            of the outbreak, a few LGAs had more than 900 active cases. The video also shows how the virus
            retreated from Melbourne over time, in response to the strict lockdown that was imposed by
            the Victorian government.<br><br>

            The second video shows all of Victoria. It is evident that a substantial part of the state 
            remained relatively untouched by the virus, even at the peak of the second wave, and that 
            transmission of the virus largely stayed localised around Greater Melbourne and Central
            Victoria.

        <h2>Graphs</h2>
        <p>
            Here, you can search or type the name(s) of one (or many) LGA(s), in order to see how the active
            case numbers grew and fell throughout the second wave. The graphs share the same set of
            axes so you can compare the progress of your selected LGAs.<br><br>

            Depending on your device, you can hover or click on any point of interest in order to see 
            the number of active cases on that date. If the graph looks too narrow on your screen, turn your
            device sideways and view it in landscape mode.
