        <p>
            Welcome. This website documents Victoria's progression through a second wave of COVID-19.
            On this page, you will find videos and graphs that are updated once a day by 5:20PM AEST, 
            after the Victorian DHHS (Department of Health and Human Services) has released its data.
            These videos and graphs show how the number of active cases in each LGA (local government area)
            has changed throughout the second wave.<br><br>

            This website charts the second wave from June 14 onwards, as this is the last
            date before the total number of active cases in Victoria entered double digits. From this point on,
            the number of cases began to increase beyond the levels seen in the first wave of the virus.

        <h2>Videos</h2>
        <p>
            The first video shows how the virus has spread across Melbourne during the second wave. At the peak
            of the outbreak, a few LGAs had more than 900 active cases. The video also shows how the virus has
            retreated from Melbourne over time, in response to the strict lockdown that has been imposed by
            the Victorian government.<br><br>

            The second video shows all of Victoria. It is evident that a substantial part of the state 
            has remained relatively untouched by the virus, even at the peak of the second wave, and that 
            transmission of the virus has largely stayed localised around Greater Melbourne and Central
            Victoria.

        <h2>Graphs</h2>
        <p>
            Here, you can search or type the name(s) of one (or many) LGA(s), in order to see how the active
            case numbers have grown and fallen throughout the second wave. The graphs share the same set of
            axes so you can compare the progress of your selected LGAs.<br><br>

            Depending on your device, you can hover or click on any point of interest in order to see 
            the number of active cases on that date. If the graph looks too narrow on your screen, turn your
            device sideways and view it in landscape mode.
